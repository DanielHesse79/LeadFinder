# 🧭 Navigation Menu Update

## 🎯 **Logical Reorganization**

### **Problem Identified**
The API Keys section was incorrectly placed under "Data Mining" in the navigation menu, which doesn't make logical sense since API keys are configuration/settings rather than data mining tools.

### **Solution Implemented**

#### **Before (Incorrect Placement)**
```
Data Mining
├── Unified Search
├── API Keys ❌ (Wrong location)
├── Web Search
├── Research APIs
├── Lead Management
├── Researcher Database
└── AutoGPT Analysis
```

#### **After (Correct Placement)**
```
Data Mining
├── Unified Search
├── Web Search
├── Research APIs
├── Lead Management
├── Researcher Database
└── AutoGPT Analysis

Settings
├── Configuration
└── API Keys ✅ (Correct location)
```

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **Navigation Template Update**
- **Removed**: API Keys from Data Mining dropdown

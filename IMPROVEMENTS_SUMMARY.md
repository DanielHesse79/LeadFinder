- Configurable alert thresholds
- Historical metric tracking
- Alert management system
- Comprehensive health status aggregation

**Benefits**:
- Real-time visibility into system status
- Proactive issue detection
- Performance monitoring
- Capacity planning

**Dependencies**: Added `psutil>=5.9.0` to `requirements.txt`
